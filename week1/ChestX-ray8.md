## Contribution
In the domain of medical images, labeled datas are usually valuable because of the needs of professional annotations. This paper use some NLP technique to text-mine data from associated radiological reports and presents a **new chest database named "ChestX-ray8"** comprising a large amount of labeled data (around 109k images with 33k unique patients).
Besides the provided dataset, the authors also presents **unified framework** to solve a weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and pathology localization problem.
