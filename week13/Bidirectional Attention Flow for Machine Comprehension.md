# Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension
This works proposed a new architecture **Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network** to solve the 
problem **machine comprehension (MC)**. The performance (compared to current work in 2019) is not the best,
but the significance of this paper lies on the proposal of **bi-directional attention** and its insight
when dealing with language tasks.
