# [Paper reading] Graph Embedding and Extensions: A General Framework for Dimensionality Reduction

## Introduction
This is a survey paper about **dimensionality reduction** methods (e.g. PCA, LDA, LPP, ISOMAP, LLE) framework under an general **graph embedding** formulation. It also presented a new supervised approach called **Marginal Fisher Analysis**.
