## Introduction
Survey paper

In this article, we provide an overview of deep-learning methods used for  face  recognition.  We  discuss  different  modules  involved  in  designing an automatic face recognition system and the role of deep  learning  for  each  of  them

In  this  article,  we  present  an  overview  of  recent  automatic  face identification and verification systems based on deep learning.

Traditional:
1. face detector
2. localize the important facial landmarks -> align faces
3. feature descriptor -> similarity scores
work well on images, degrades  significantly  on face images or videos that have large variations in pose, illu-mination,  resolution,  expression,  age,  background  clutter,  and  occlusion.

Deep learning:
large amount of training data represents significant variations in pose, illumination, expression, and occlusion, which enables the DCNNs to be robust to these variations and extract meaningful features required for the task.
